                <h1>What is happening to <u>stray animals?</u></h1>
                <p class="statistics_body">Hundreds of cats and dogs get put into <i>animal shelters</i> every year. These animals can range from being years old to only a couple months. Some of these animals come from <i>pet farms</i>, where cats and dogs are forced to breed in order for the puppies and kittens to be sold in pet shops. Depending on the shelter, the cats and dogs can only stay for several weeks before being culled. This is only a small portion of the problem. There are still thousands of stay cats and dogs roaming the streets of Japan as well as the world. In one shelter in Australia, they had over 600 dogs and cats put into the shelter every year. This is a problem that is prevalent all over the world, and hundreds of animal lives are lost every week.</p>

                <h1>Why are their stray animals?</h1>
                <p class="column"><b>Irresponsible pet owners</b><br/>Pet owners that adopt pets when they are young and then release them when they are old or because of other reasons, create a large portion of stray animals. If you cannot keep your pet anymore the most responsible action is to admit it into a shelter. </p>
                <p class="column"><strong>Not Neutering Pets</strong><br/>By not neutering your pets and then releasing them into the wild, you exponentially increase the animal population in your area. This is why animal shelters, often after receiving a pet into the shelter, neuter them. </p>
                <p class="column"><strong>Adoption from pet shops</strong><br/>Adopting from pet shops rather then your local shelter increases the number of animals in shelters as well as increases the number of animals shelters have to cull. By choosing to adopt from shelters, it helps the shelters as well as the animals. </p>

                    <p class="app_body">Animal Protection Project (APP) is run by 7 students who love animals and want to save dogs and cats being abandoned by people and killed in animal shelters in Japan. Our ultimate goal is to create a society where people and animals live in harmony. We are trying to reduce the number of dogs and cats killed in animal shelters in Japan to 0. We will approach our goal by raising people’s awareness of animal welfare, spreading the idea of all animals are equal, and taking initiative to help animals find their new home and family. For example, by making videos about the plight of animals in shelters might raise the general public’s awareness towards the problem. Moreover, if we start taking action, even if it is a tiny little step, we believe it can make a big audacious change.
